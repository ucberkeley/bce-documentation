BCE Documentation Github Repo
=============================

If you would like help installing or using BCE, then you are probably
looking for:

[The Official BCE Documentation](http://ucberkeley.github.io/bce-documentation/)

If you're reading this page then you've somehow found your way "behind
the curtain", "beyond the looking glass", or "<insert>some other
fantastical literary reference</insert>".

You're welcome to look around or contribute. :)

But most likely you really just want to go read:
